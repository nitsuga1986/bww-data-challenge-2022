## Local Frog Discovery Tool

### Challenge Objective
Build a Species Distribution Model for the frog species - "Litoria Fallax" across Australia using TerraClimate variables.

### This Repo
This repo contains a jupyter notebook with the Data processing techniques and ML model resulting in the 2nd place for the 2022 Better Working World Data Challenge.

### Data used
* For Target variable - Frog occurrence datasets (Australia)
* For Predictor variables - TerraClimate dataset (Climatic variables) available on Microsoft Planetary Computer portal (You will find additional information for the data to be used in the Data Description tab).

### Challange Summary
Participants are expected to complete the biodiversity-related learning on the Data Challenge platform, including how specific species are important indicators of biodiversity health in a given environment. Using this knowledge, participants will build models to locate biodiversity – specifically for frogs, as frogs are a go-to for scientists wanting to study the health of a particular ecosystem. The best models will be made available to government, researchers and industry to help guide conservation and restoration initiatives. Collectively we can help save the plants, animals and microorganisms that are critical to a healthy society and a thriving economy.

### How will it change lives?
It is aligned to EY's sustainability agenda, which aims to infuse sustainability in all what we do. We do this by collaborating across functions and by upskilling our people to apply technology to sustainability. 
It is an amplifier, encouraging participation, pride, and focus. Being focused on a meaningful topic is a natural way to boost one’s sense of belonging.
The winning outputs will help scientists, policymakers and governments protect and predict the richness of biodiversity in a specific area. The best models will be made available to the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre, as well as government, researchers and industry to help guide conservation and restoration initiatives. Collectively we can help save the plants, animals and microorganisms that are critical to a healthy society and a thriving economy.


### Data Processing and Modeling
In the supporting document you will find the data processing thechniques and modelling that resulted in global runner-up in the 2022 Better Working World Data Challenge. This approch resulted in a 0.77 score out of 1.0 will be generated based on the F1 performance metric. 

This challenge has been co-created with remote sensing expertise from NASA (Dr. Brian Killough) and Swinburne University (Dr. Jack White), and biodiversity expertise from the Australian Museum (Dr. Jodi Rowley) and the CSIRO (Dr. Cam Slatyer). The notebook connects to public facing data sources on Microsoft’s Planetary Computer.
